# Game summary
This is a soccer-themed Pong-style game created in Greenfoot. Players control paddle-like goalies, aiming to score goals by getting the ball past their opponent. The game can be played in singleplayer or multiplayer mode.

In singleplayer mode, random power-up perks appear to enhance gameplay:

    Potion: Enlarges the player's paddle (goalie).

    Banana: Increases the player's movement speed.

    Star: Instantly gives the player 1 point.

The first player to score 10 goals wins the game.
